## Overview

Risk Factors Scores for Perinatal Mental Health are derived by an algorithm incorporating:

- 19 factors that are shown to be associated with a greater risk of perinatal mental health disorders, and

- 3 factors which are direct measures of need.

US regions with compounded perinatal mental health risk factors may be in greater need of high-quality, person-centered perinatal mental health support.

## Geography

The study area consists of 3143 second level political divisions, including every county, parish, borough, and county-equivalent municipality within the 51 first level divisions which comprise the 50 states and the federal district.

A large contingent of the data is sourced from the County Health Rankings published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. The CHR data does not include data for the five populated U.S. territories, therefore those divisions have been omitted from the scoring and analysis.

The CHR and CDC data includes Valdez-Cordova census area (FIPS: 02261), an unorganized borough of Alaska that was abolished in 2019 and replaced by the census areas of Chugach (FIPS: 02063) and Copper River (FIPS: 02066). Data from Valdez-Cordova was applied to Chugach and Copper River for each risk factor component that uses CHR data.

Data from the CDC on Cesarean section deliveries includes Wade Hampton census area (AK FIPS:02270), which in 2015 was renamed Kusilvak census area (AK FIPS:02158); the data was adjusted accordingly.

Data from the CDC on Cesarean section deliveries includes Shannon County (SD FIPS:02270), which in 2015 was renamed Oglala County (SD FIPS:02158); the data was adjusted accordingly.

## Risk Factors

Perinatal health risk factors are divided into three tiers, using a scale which allocates:\
&emsp;&emsp;up to (3) points per Tier I qualifier,\
&emsp;&emsp;up to (2) points per Tier II qualifier, and\
&emsp;&emsp;up to (1) point per Tier III qualifier.\
Additionally, there are several Direct Measures of Need, which are allocated up to (3) points per qualifier.\
The Maximum Point Total is 45.

## Perinatal Mental Healthcare Providers

Perinatal mental healthcare providers are essential to the task of responding to and treating mothers experiencing mental distress. Without access to professional help, new mothers are left alone to struggle with their own thoughts and feelings, while they are also responsible for providing all the normal care required by their infants and young children.

The detrimental effects of a supply deficit in perinatal mental healthcare can spiral outward, as at-risk mothers left untreated begin to suffer collateral consequences, which can also involve their children and result in a diminishment in the level of care they receive.

We have gathered data from a variety of authoritative sources in order to quantify the level of provider care available in each county where risk factor scores have been produced.

## PostgreSQL Tables and Queries

The folder [pgSQL](pgSQL) contains the SQL files necessary to construct and populate the database from the CSV records contained in [csv](csv).

The file [pgSQL/factors-county.sql](pgSQL/factors-county.sql) defines the basic tables for all county level risk factors and loads each table from CSV.

The file [pgSQL/factors-state.sql](pgSQL/factors-county.sql) defines the basic tables for all state level risk factors and loads each table from CSV.

The file [pgSQL/prfs-county.sql](pgSQL/prfs-county.sql) defines the summary tables for each county level risk factor.

The file [pgSQL/prfs-state.sql](pgSQL/prfs-state.sql) defines the summary tables for each state level risk factor.

The file [pgSQL/scores.sql](pgSQL/scoring.sql) aggregates all of the factor data and scoring, and the composite score for each county, into one table, and exports to CSV at [csv/prfs_counties.csv](csv/prfs_counties.csv)

The file [pgSQL/providers.sql](pgSQL/providers.sql) constructs the PSI Certified MH Providers table and loads the data from CSV.

The file [pgSQL/copy2json.sql](pgSQL/copy2json.sql) creates JSON files for each table in the perinatal_risk_factors database.

## Perinatal Risk Factor Scores

The data was aggregated in [pgSQL/scores.sql](pgSQL/scoring.sql) and exported to CSV at [csv/prfs_counties.csv](csv/prfs_counties.csv)\
The aforementioned file is a table containing each county's FIPS identifier along with the risk factor scores for each of the 22 risk factors, and an aggregate column "PRFS".  Each risk factor includes the factor, the factor score, and the quartile of the factor within the national dataset.
